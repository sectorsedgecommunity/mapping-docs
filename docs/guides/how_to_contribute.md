# How to contribute
If you wish to contribute to the map making documentation, whether it be a guide, new page, or edits to an existing page, follow the methods below. I, RainlessSky, am really the only person working on this and so its probably good to contact me for anonymous contributions.

* Make a fork of the `main` branch, do what you wish, make a pull request and we'll review it.
* If you want to contribute anonymously, contact me: @rainlesssky on Discord. Optionally include a commit message for me to include.
