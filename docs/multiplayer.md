# Multiplayer

## Setting up a custom map for use
Make sure all contents of a folder have the same name as the parent folder. Servers don't need the `.vox`.

## Limitations
* `forcemap` cannot pick a custom map with a space in the file name.
* Allegiance cannot be modified
* The map `Name` is only used for the post-vote summary
* `preview.jpg` isn't used in the map vote or post-vote summary
* Grass does not appear in custom maps, in multiplayer.
