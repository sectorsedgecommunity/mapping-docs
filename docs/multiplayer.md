# Multiplayer

### Setting up a custom map for use
Make sure all contents of a folder have the same name as the parent folder. A `vox` file is not needed when on a server.

### Limitations
* `forcemap` cannot pick a custom map with a space in the file name.
* The map `Name` is only used for the post-vote summary.
* `preview.jpg` isn't used in the map vote screen.
  * This has been confirmed to be intentional behavior.
* Grass (particles) do not appear in custom maps, in multiplayer.
