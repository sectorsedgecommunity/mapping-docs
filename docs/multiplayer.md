# Multiplayer

## Setting up a custom map for use
Make sure all contents of a folder have the same name as the parent folder. A `vox` file is not needed when on a server.

## Bonuses
- `forcemap` can pick maps with incorrect Static map size, and still be playable.

## Limitations
* `forcemap` cannot pick a custom map with a space in the file name.
* Allegiance does not visually appear in map vote preview images
  * If allegiance music plays needs testing.
* The map `Name` is only used for the post-vote summary
* `preview.jpg` isn't used in the map vote or post-vote summary
* Grass (particles) do not appear in custom maps, in multiplayer.
