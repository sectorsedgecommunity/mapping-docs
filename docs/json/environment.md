## Environment
This page contains all attributes related to a map's environment, such as skybox, ambience, sun, and more.
```json
// SkyboxType: valid options: ad, cf, rw, is, lb, mc, st
// AD: Used on Aegis Desert, Devoid Wasteland. Open desert with a clear sky, mountains and plenty of sand. A pink planet (moon?) and blue planet with rings.
// CF: Used on Crashed Freighter, Soltec Plaza. Pretty red mountains at sunset in the open waters. No planets visible but plenty of very bright stars.
// RW: Used on Railway, Reactor. Foggy city with partial clouds, and futuristic skyscrapers riddled with pipes. No planets visible.
// IS: Used on Ice Station, Corahk Canyon, Cold Harbour. Coastline of an island with extreme snow mountains, partial clouds. No planets visible. This skybox/planet is confirmed to be NYX-03.
// LB: Used on Laboratory. Cloud planet with futuristic skyscrapers at sunset. A blue gas planet is visible. This may be the same planet seen in the default Space skybox.
// MC: Used on Magma Chamber, Base Omicron. Blue-gray harsh mountains with some "pwetty stars" (quote from Paddy on Steam). Unlit-side of a planet with a blue atmosphere. This MAY be the same planet as in the default Space skybox, but I don't think this is confirmed.
// ST: Used on Soltrium Temple, Shrine, Aegis Oasis, Devoid Cathedral. Pleasant blue-gray mountains with medium clouds. Red planet and a gray moon(?) visible.
// SkyboxRotation: Pitch/yaw of skybox. 6.283 is approximately 360 degrees on both. Ï€*2?
// SkyboxVerticalOffset: Vertical offset of the literal sky box. +0.93 or -0.93 maximum before the void is exposed.
"SkyboxType": "rw",
"SkyboxRotation": [ 0, 0.7 ],
"SkyboxVerticalOffset": 0.0,
// Enclosed: If true, disables shadows, skybox, and crepuscular rays. This also makes the top of the map not meshed, which lets you see into the map from the spawn screen.
"Enclosed": false,
// CustomSkyboxColour: Determines if the skybox is a flat 2-color sky. True/false.
    // HorizonColour: Color of horizon. RGBA?
    // TopColour: Color of top half of sky. RGBA?

```json
// SunColour: Regular color of the sun, in RGB.
// SunColourRaining: Color of sun when raining, in RGB.
// SunRotation: Rotation of the sun.
// CrepuscularThresholdOverride: Probably threshold to render crepuscular rays. 0.0 to ~2.0; though it does start to get a bit glitchy after about 1.5.
// CrepuscularStartHeight: Probably lowers where the sun would be, relative to clouds? Because lowering this value causes more rays to shine through. 0.0-1.0.
// SunDiffuseStrength: The strength of the sun. >0.0. Defaults to 0.001.

```json
// RainColour: RGBA color of rain. A controls bloom.

// Server randomly picks a number between those 2 numbers for when to start raining.
// RainDensity: Amount of rain particles spawned. Percentage 0.0-1.0. 0.75 for 25% less rain particles.

// WindDirection: Yaw direction of wind. Pushes rain and leaf particles horizontally.

"WindDirection": 0.785375,
```

```json
// Snow is seperate from Rain. Snow immediately begins falling from match start.
// HasFallingSnow: Boolean, Controls whether the map has falling snow.
// HasBlizzardSnow: Boolean, Blizzard snow has more intense, non-customizable wind applied. Overrides HasFallingSnow.
// SnowIndex: Index used for voxels placed by snowfall. Don't think this works anymore.
// FallingSnowColour: RGBA color of snowflakes. A controls bloom.
