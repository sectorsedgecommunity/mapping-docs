            // ControlShiftSpawnOffset: Seperate from TeamSpawns. Default value is 0.2, i.e. 20%

            //
            // Type: box, line, radius
            // Team: 0, 1
            // Min & Max: max must be greater than min, otherwise have glitchy spawn area
            // OOBDistance: out of bounds distance from the spawn: known to be used for BRK
            // SearchTopDown: searches top->down instead
